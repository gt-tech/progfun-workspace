* Book "Programming in Scala, Second Edition" - finished Chapter 32 (skipped as scala actors deprecated), 33 (skipped - advanced and no immediate need for application), 34 (skipped - no immediate need to learn GUI programming beyond HTML/Javascript so skipping this (haven't even used swing in java in the past), 35 (skipped as will use different set of applications/project to practice hands-on scala. This practice application utilizes parsers and swing which has been skipped. May be revisit later in future time permitting to learn.)
